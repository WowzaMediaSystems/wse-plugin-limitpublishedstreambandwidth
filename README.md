# LimitPublishedStreamBandwidth
The **ModuleLimitPublishedStreamBandwidth** module for [Wowza Streaming Engine™ media server software](https://www.wowza.com/products/streaming-engine) enables you to automatically disconnect RTMP live sources that exceed a set bandwidth rate limit.

This repo includes a [compiled version](/lib/wse-plugin-limitpublishedstreambandwidth.jar).

## Prerequisites
Wowza Streaming Engine 4.0.0 or later is required.

## Usage
The **ModuleLimitPublishedStreamBandwidth** module enables you to configure a maximum bitrate for an application. When an RTMP stream is published to the configured application, it's monitored continuously to ensure its bitrate stays within the set limit. If the stream bitrate exceeds the limit, the RTMP source is disconnected.
